# Satellite-movement-modeling

Made by Bolohan Marian Cristian

This project models and simulates the motion of two satellites using MATLAB and Simulink, based on a system of differential equations. It includes a custom implementation of the Runge-Kutta integration method, performance comparisons with MATLAB’s built-in solvers, and robustness testing under parameter uncertainties.

## Features

- 🛰️ Simulation of two-body satellite motion
- 🔁 Custom Runge-Kutta integration method (4th order)
- ⚙️ Comparison with standard MATLAB ODE solvers (e.g., `ode45`)
- 🎯 Parameter sensitivity analysis using:
  - Additive uncertainties
  - Multiplicative uncertainties
- 📊 Visualization of trajectories and performance metrics
